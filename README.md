# BitZero ($BIT) Airdrop Claim Tutorial

This guide will walk you through the process of claiming your $BIT airdrop.

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

1.  On the airdrop page, click the **`[ Connect Wallet ]`** button.
2.  A pop-up will appear. Select your preferred wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Bitget, OKX).
3.  Approve the connection request in your wallet.

### Step 2: Check Your Allocation

1.  The website will automatically check your wallet's eligibility.
2.  If your wallet is eligible, your allocation will be displayed (e.g., `You are Eligible!ðŸ’™ðŸ’œ`).

> **Note:** If you are not eligible, the page will show a corresponding message. Don't worry, you can follow our channels and participate in the next phase!

### Step 3: Complete Verification Tasks

1.  To unlock the claim button, you must complete two simple tasks.
2.  Click the **`Follow @BitZerodotBase on X`** link. The page will open, and the task will be automatically checked off.
3.  Click the **`Join Telegram Channel`** link. The page will open, and this task will also be automatically checked off.

### Step 4: Claim Your $BIT Tokens

1.  Once both tasks are checked, the **`[ Claim ]`** button will activate.
2.  Click the **`[ Claim ]`** button.
3.  Your wallet will open and ask you to confirm the transaction. You will need a small amount of ETH on Base for the gas fee.
